在准备一个验证0..1000中有多少个"7"时，就随手下了个CLion。
之前一直是在实验室的电脑用CLion写C++来着，用着很舒服。
对CLion进行配置之后进行编译时出现以下错误：

熬夜到3点都没查出来CMake是怎么读取系统文件的。

Finally, I solved my problems here. It seems to be unusual.

  - *The errors listed about CMake were caused by incorrectly invoking`uname`.*

I checked out the [CMake manual][1], and I found that my mac produced the wrong [CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME][2] results. And after test `uname` on my terminal, I found that maybe the kernel used wrong command. And then I `echo $PATH` found that my `$PATH` changed by cocos2d-x installed yesterday. The new `$PATH` include my `uname` programmed for study, and it overrided the kernel `uname`. After I delete `my uname`, clean CMake, restart CLion, everything is just going fine. Done. 


这个uname是去年做毕设时余留的产物，所以覆盖了kernel中的`uname`。

最后附上那个0..1000中有多少个"7"的验证程序。其实更简单的算法是把1-999中的个位、十位、百位中7做组合也就是每一位为7的数有`10 * 10 = 100`个，总共就是`100 * 3 = 300`个。

{% highlight ruby %}
#include <iostream>
using namespace::std;
int main() {
    int m, n;
    int temp, count = 0;
    cin >> m >> n;
    for (int i = m; i < n; i++){
        temp = i;
        while (temp) {
            if ((temp % 10) == 7){
                count ++;
            }
            temp /= 10;
        }
    }
    cout << "numbers of 7: " << count << endl;
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
